<!--
This is basically the same as koala-sampler.xml, but deals with 3 Pd MIDI
inputs and outputs, which is useful if you want to hook up a secondary
controller such as the Launch Control XL alongside the APC mini or the
Launchpad. This requires that you have set up Pd with 3 ALSA MIDI inputs and
outputs, as follows:

pd -alsamidi -mididev 0,1,2

This should create the 'Pure Data' ALSA MIDI client for both input and output,
with ports 0, 1, and 2 as writable (Pd input) and ports 3, 4, and 5 as
readable (Pd output) ports. (This is what the snapshot assumes, otherwise you
may have to change the Pd client names and port numbers below accordingly.)

  <!-- This should work with either the mk1 or mk2 version of the APC mini.
       CAVEAT: Don't try to mix both types of devices, otherwise the
       koala-sampler.pd patch will get confused about the type of device it is
       connected to. The mk1 and mk2 versions are *not* compatible! -->
