<!--
Snapshot for running koala-sampler.pd alongside the Koala Sampler app on
Linux, which sets up the required ALSA connections automatically. NOTE: This
requires that you have set up Pd with 2 ALSA MIDI inputs and outputs, e.g.:

pd -alsamidi -mididev 0,1

This should create the 'Pure Data' ALSA MIDI client for both input and output,
with ports 0 and 1 as writable (Pd input) and port 2 and 3 as readable (Pd
output) ports. (This is what the snapshot assumes, otherwise you may have to
change the Pd client names and port numbers below accordingly.)

Launch Pd and Koala, then run:

aj-snapshot -rax koala-alsa.xml

Please check https://aj-snapshot.sourceforge.io/ for details. The -ra options
tell aj-snapshot to restore the ALSA MIDI connections from the file, while
keeping the audio connections intact. The -x option makes sure that we start
from a clean slate and get rid of Koala's default MIDI connections. (We
*cannot* leave these as they are, as they will interfere with the operation of
the koala-sampler.pd patch.)

Finally open the koala-sampler.pd patch. (Opening the patch *after* the
connections have been set up will make sure that the APC mini device gets
initialized properly in Pd.)

NOTE: This snapshot will also help you set up connections if Koala runs on
some other device. In that case just replace the "RtMidi Input Client" entry
below by whatever ALSA MIDI client you use for the connection (usually some
MIDI over USB, Bluetooth, or RTP client).

  <!-- This should work with either the mk1 or mk2 version of the APC mini.

       koala-sampler.pd patch will get confused about the type of device it is
       connected to. The mk1 and mk2 versions are *not* compatible! -->
